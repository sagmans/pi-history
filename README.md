# pi-history

Ghost completion for prompt history across [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) sessions.

`pi-history` records your real prompts. Two isolation levels — `project`
(default: one history per project) and `global` (one host-wide history) —
configured under `~/.pi/agent/pi-history/`.

## Features

- Captures TUI input; skips extension-injected messages and blank prompts; preserves multiline text.
- Caps each project at `maxEntries`; exact duplicates move to newest instead of storing copies.
- `/pi-history status` — metadata only. `/pi-history clear` — confirms, then wipes and records a clear marker.
- `Ctrl+R` — fuzzy reverse search; Enter replaces the buffer, Escape restores the draft.
- Ghost completion (best effort): dim prefix-match suffix, `Ctrl+E` accepts all, `Alt+Right` accepts the next word. Degrades gracefully when editor support is missing.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-history
```

Install from npm so pi only offers updates after a published release.

## Supported environments

| Component | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| OS | macOS (primary), Linux. Windows unsupported (POSIX permissions, symlinks). |
| Node.js | `>=22.19.0` (CI tests `22.19.0` and `24`) |
| pi | `>=0.80.x`, tested at `0.81.1` |
| Terminal | tested under [herdr](https://github.com/fitchmultz/herdr) and standard macOS terminals |
| Mode | TUI only. RPC, JSON, and print are inert. |

## Configuration

```json
{ "maxEntries": 2000, "isolationLevel": "project" }
```

User config lives in the data directory (`~/.pi/agent/pi-history/`), not the
installed package, so it survives `pi update`. Precedence (lowest → highest):
built-in defaults → shipped `config.json` → `config.json` → `config.local.json`.
The highest file that mentions an option wins; an invalid value falls back to
the default with a warning.

## Diagnostics

`/pi-history status` prints one versioned, privacy-safe line, e.g.
`pi-history: diagnosticsVersion=2; state=healthy; initialization=ready; storage=ready; editor=ready; entries=12; cap=2000; scope=project`.
